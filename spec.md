// Trade belongs_to :trader, belongs_to :instrument

- [x] Include at least one has_many through relationship (x has_many y through z e.g. Recipe has_many Items through Ingredients)

Confirm:
- [ ] The application is pretty DRY
- [ ] Limited logic in controllers
- [ ] Views use helper methods if appropriate
- [ ] Views use partials if appropriate
